This package contains vim settings and plugins customized for my needs.
The goal of having this package is to ensure that it is easy to install them.

Installation instructions
=========================

First of all the package has to be retrieved from github:
```bash

And go to the cloned directory:

Then ensure modules have updated code:

Now when we have all the required code, proceed with instaling it:
